CI pipelines and testing
------------------------

### Github actions
Github action workflows are set up for code quality checks, build and testing. These pipelines are triggered on each push and pull request for the `develop` and `master` branches, and also can be started manually on Github on any branch.

* `code-check-build.yml`: This workflow is responsible for linting, format check and to make sure that builds are passing for each component.

Testing locally
---------------

### Code quality checks
Husky is set up to run the linter and check code formatting before each commit.
These checks however can also be run using the `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` commands for the entire repository.
